<h1>Upb@Hub</h1>

What it does:
  - it shows the schedule
 Â - it asks you to login, but you can't create an account (this is a feature from the very first versiom of this app. It will be removed in the next update)

What it will do (hopefully):
  - let users add schedules
  - show courses you are enrolled in on cs.curs (will need your cs.curs account, but it won't save it outside your phone)
  - show your marks from studenti.pub.ro
  - show info about teachers (email, their office and office hours if known)

I want the app to gather every website we need in uni (acs.pub.ro for schedule, studenti.pub.ro for marks and the forums on cs.curs.pub.ro) under one roof, named Upb@Hub.
